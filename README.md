# gtasarce

A command-line utility to modify the vehicles in Grand Theft Auto: San
Andreas races. By default, the vehicles in races (including the
player's) are hardcoded in this installment of the GTA series.

Includes a Dev-C++ project file for compilation under Windows / MinGW.
Note that at least the include / library paths must be changed. It is
most likely possible to compile on most Unix-like systems, but a
Makefile is not included. The only external requirement is
[GLib](https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/).

Run `gtasarce.exe --help` for usage instructions.

This is a legacy project not under active development. Feel free to fork
and improve.
